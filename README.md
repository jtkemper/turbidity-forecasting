Developing models and forecasting turbidity in Esopus Creek, NY

## Overview
In this repo, we share several codes for transforming flow forecasts (from NOAA River Forecast Centers and the U.S. National Water Model) into forecasts of turbidity. This intended as a proof-of-concept for building water quality forecasts from high-resolution monitoring data and a streamflow forecast source of your choice. The testbed for this approach is Esopus Creek, NY, a highly instrumented watershed in the Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York, USA.
